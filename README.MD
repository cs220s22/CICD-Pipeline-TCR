## Overview
This project is a representation of how a CI/CD pipeline could be implemented and make a team of indivduals more productive by automating both the testing before production, and deployment there afterwards. The CI/CD Pipeline allowed us to learn github actions, where we would use triggers such as pull requests to both test and lint our code before automating the process of deploying it via our Heroku server.
